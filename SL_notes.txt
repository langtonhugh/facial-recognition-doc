- Date column is not formatted correctly for me when
  loading (only some). For example, row 1 has a Date of '44137'.
- Those that are, do not always match the Year column.
  (e.g., row 4 when loaded into R) although this doesn't look common.
- how was this data created? I think the whole pipeline should
  be coded... especially when the Ward data is approximate.
- are these actually Wards? How are they defined? I only get information
  on facial recognition from 72 wards, but if i understood correctly,
  there are over 600 in Greater London.
- filling in with zero: do we know why some araes did not
  have facial recognition data? Was it because there really was zero
  done? Or because there is no data on it? If the latter, I don't think
  zero makes sense. It could also be due to some data handling beforehand
  relating to the Ward data, but we don't know.
